*Basic flow chart of the ten nGIST modules. The top four are preparatory modules, while the bottom six are the science modules. Only the preparatory modules must be run - all others can be switched on or off according to a user's wishes. What is shown here is the recommended running sequence. In theory, the science mmodules can be run in any order.*

- Configuration is controlled by a config .yaml file. This file houses the variables required.
